Hi! 
This is a desktop application, It's a food order system based on layered architecture pattern made with C# WPF using Material Design 
for aesthetics details and connected to a SQL server database.

If you want to try it, you have to import the sql script that is on the repo and see the data of the "usuarios" table.
Credentials for the administrative user:
user: Admin
pass: 12345

If you choose to use the client role you have to do the registration process pressing the button "Registarse" below "Iniciar Sesion".

Hope you enjoy it!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
